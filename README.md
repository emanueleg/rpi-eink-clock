# Raspberry Pi eInk Smart Clock - Waveshare 2.7inch e-Paper HAT Clock Display for Raspberry Pi

Smart Clock for Raspbery Pi 3 using the e-Paper 2.7 inch display from Waveshare.

Originally inspired by the [vekkari](https://github.com/jaittola/vekkari) project by [Jukka Aittola](https://github.com/jaittola), this project has quickly evolved into a new project: a fully-featured smart clock. All you need is a Raspberry-Pi 3/4 and the e-Paper 2.7 inch display from Waveshare.

The eInk Smart Clock has multiple display modes, selectable using the four push-buttons soldered on the HAT:
- Raspberry Pi Logo (sort of standby mode)
- Clock (hours and minutes, day of the week, date) with 1 minute refresh interval
- System statics  (CPU, RAM, Processes, IP addresses)
- Nobel Prize information (year, category, winner and motivation - offline dump of the official data obtained from http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/prize.json)
